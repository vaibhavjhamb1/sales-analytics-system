The system is designed to handle "messy" data. The cleaning module implements the following rules:Invalid Records Removed:Records missing a CustomerID or Region.Records with Quantity $\le 0$ or UnitPrice $\le 0$.TransactionID values that do not start with the character 'T'.Valid Records Cleaned:Commas are removed from ProductName (e.g., "Mouse,Wireless" becomes "MouseWireless").Commas are removed from numeric values (e.g., "1,500" becomes "1500") to allow for mathematical analysis.Empty lines are automatically skipped.
